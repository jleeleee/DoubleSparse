{"pred": " yes. When visual context is available (W+C+V), we see that the model performance greatly improves over the textual models (W+C), showing that visual contexts are complimentary to textual information in named entity recognition tasks. In addition, it can be seen that the modality attention module further improves the entity type recognition performance for (W+C+V). This result indicates that the modality attention is able to focus on the most effective modality (visual, words, or characters) adaptive to each sample to maximize information gain. Note that our text-only model (W+C) with the modality attention module also significantly outperform the state", "answers": ["Yes", "Yes"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3784}
