{"pred": " Yes. The proposed multimodal NER model learns NER from both text and images. The model is built on a Bi-LSTM-CRF model that takes as input a sequence of tokens, each of which comprises a word token, a character sequence, and an image, in their respective representation. The model combines word embeddings, character embeddings, and visual features (extracted from a pre-trained InceptionNet) to produce a label for each token maximizing the following objective. The model can be trained via log-likelihood maximization for the training set. The model can be trained with or without the modality attention module.
